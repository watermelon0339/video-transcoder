**This application was built specifically for the Adocasts workflow.**

MacOS command line application that transcodes a queue of video files from a source location to an output location. Each file will be converted into an HLS streamable playlist consisting of video segments for the desired resolutions.

For the output destination selected, when the `USE_UNIQUE_NAME` option is false each video's transcoded playlist will be placed inside a folder named after the file. When true, each video will be placed inside a folder named with a unique id. For each playlist, the resolution segments will be placed in a subfolder named for the resolution.

For example, if the video is called `adonisjs-quick-tip.mp4` and the resolutions 2160p and 1080p are selected, the output will look as such:

```
.
└── [selected destination]/
    └── adonisjs-quick-tip/
        ├── {resolution}p/
        │   ├── adonisjs-quick-tip_{resolution}_001.ts
        │   ├── adonisjs-quick-tip_{resolution}_002.ts
        │   ├── adonisjs-quick-tip_{resolution}_003.ts
        │   └── adonisjs-quick-tip_{resolution}.m3u8
        ├── en.srt [english srt transcription]
        ├── en.txt [english plaintext transcription]
        ├── {code}.srt [srt translations as defined within the env]
        ├── video.mp4 [compressed original]
        ├── video.webp [6s animated webp]
        └── master.m3u8
```

### Features

- Transcribes batch of videos into HLS parts
- Compresses source file to MP4

### Requirements

The following dependencies need to be installed and accessible via their CLI commands on your system for this application to work. These are not bundled as part of this application.

- [Ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Used to transcode and compress videos
- [Faster Whisper (Python)](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) - Used to generate a transcription of videos
- [Argos Translate (Python)](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) - Used to translate the video transcriptions

### Todos

- [x] Include compressed video file (for downloading)
- [x] Generate 6s animated webp image
- [x] Killing NodeJS spawn (cancelling) doesn't cascade through to ffmpeg
- [x] Generate transcription from video
- [x] Translate video transcription to Spanish and French
- [ ] Upload generated files to Cloudflare R2 (not doing for now, prefer to review before uploading)

### 用法

```bash
# 1️⃣首次安装依赖
npm install

# 2️⃣构建本地转码运行时，构建之后的文件存放于 build 目录
npm build

# 3️⃣拷贝转码配置文件到 build 目录
cp .env.example build/.env

# 4️⃣ 修改配置，尤其是 SOURCE_LOCATION OUTPUT_LOCATION RESOLUTIONS 这3个
# 为了节省流量，建议设置RESOLUTIONS=480或720,480

# 5️⃣转码：把存放在 SOURCE_LOCATION 里的视频，全部转码到 OUTPUT_LOCATION 目录
cd build
node ace run:transcoder
```
